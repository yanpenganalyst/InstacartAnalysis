### InstacartAnalysis
This is a student project where I identified customer buying behavior for the online grocery store Instacart.
### Project overview
Instacart seeks insights into customer variety and purchasing behaviors for targeted marketing. The analysis aims to guide a strategy that ensures precise targeting of customer profiles with suitable products.
### Key questions
The key questions answered in the project are:
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
